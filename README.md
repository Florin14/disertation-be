🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction API
Welcome to the Real Estate Price Prediction API project!
This repository is all about optimizing and querying databases efficiently to predict real estate prices using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence.

We are combining the power of:

FastAPI 🚀 (lightning-fast web API framework)

Pydantic 🔥 (for robust data validation)

SQLAlchemy 🛠️ (ORM database handling)

Python 🐍 (of course!)

and real-world datasets sourced from Kaggle 📊.

🚀 Project Overview
Real estate markets are intricate, fast-moving, and data-heavy.
Our mission?
➡️ To train powerful AI models on real-world housing datasets and
➡️ To build a sleek API that can predict housing prices based on features like square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and beyond!

This project focuses heavily on:

AI-driven predictions

Backend performance and efficiency

Database optimization and intelligent querying

📦 Tech Stack
Python 3.13

FastAPI for asynchronous web API development

Pydantic for strong data modeling

SQLAlchemy for ORM/database management

SQLite / PostgreSQL (TBD) for data storage

Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for AI model training

Kaggle datasets for real-world housing data

Docker (optional) for containerized deployment

⚙️ Features (Planned)
✅ Train a deep learning AI model for real estate price prediction

✅ Implement efficient and scalable database design

✅ Expose prediction endpoints (e.g., /predict/price)

✅ Introduce caching mechanisms for ultra-fast predictions

🔄 Build a production-ready FastAPI backend

🔄 Add model retraining pipelines

🔄 Dockerize the entire application for cloud deployment

🚧 Current Status
Under Construction 🚧:
We are currently preparing datasets and building the first versions of the AI models and API endpoints!

Exciting updates are coming soon! 🚀
